# Advent of Code Day 2 - Rock Paper Scissors Part II

This folder contains the attempted solution to the second of the Advent of 
Code 22 programming challenges. For this, we want to take in a file of 
rock-paper-scissors strategies and output the overall score according to the
provided moves list which includes the opponent's move and the way in which 
the round needs to end.

You can run the program with the following invocation:

	./main.awk <filepath>

No additional tools should be necessary unless your system does not include a 
working version of AWK.
