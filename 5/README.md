# Advent of Code Day 5 - Supply Stacks

This folder contains the attempted solution to the fifth of the 2022 Advent 
of Code challenges. Here, we want to examine the initial configuration of 
supply stacks and then follow a movement procedure to determine the final 
arrangement.

You can run the program with the following invocation:

	autoreconf -i
	./configure CXXFLAGS="-std=c++20"
	make
	./main input

You'll need to have GNU autotools and a C++ toolchain installed in order to 
perform the compilation before running.
