# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 11 Monkey in the Middle

This folder contains the attempted solution to the eleventh of the Advent of 
Code 2022 challenges. In this, we want to simulate the action of monkeys 
according to a set of rules which are encoded in the input text file. At 
the end of 20 rounds, we want to know which monkeys were the most active. 
After multiplying these numbers together, we will be able to identify the 
total level of monkey business.

The following command will run the solution:

    ./main.py

As a Python script, no additional packages should be required on your system 
if Python3 comes with your OS distribution.
