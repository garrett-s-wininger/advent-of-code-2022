# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 12 Hill Climbing Algorithm

This folder contains the attempted solution to the day 12 challenge of the 
Advent of Code 2022. In this, we want to read in a heightmap of the surrounding 
area, identify our start and end locations, and then identify a route to the 
desired location in the shortest number of steps possible.

The program can be run with the following:

    ./main.pl

As the solution is implemented in Perl, a working interpreter for the language 
should be all you need to run the solution.
