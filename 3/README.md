# Advent of Code Day 3 - Rucksack Reorganization

This folder contains the attempted solution to the third of the Advent of 
Code 2022 programming challenges. The objective here is to take a file 
containing the items in rucksack compartments and output the priority items 
which are contained in both the left and right compartements.

You can run the program with the following:

	dotnet run input

As far as tooling is concerned, you will need to download the latest dotnet
version form Microsoft in order to build and run the project.
