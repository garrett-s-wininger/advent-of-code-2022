# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 10 Cathode-Ray Tube

This folder contains the attempted solution to the tenth of the Advent of Code 
2022 challenges. In this, we want to simulate a CPU containing noop and addx 
instructions wich take varying cycles to complete. At certain points, we'll 
take the value of the underlying register and multiply by the cycle count 
to determine signal strength.

The following command will run the solution:

    dotnet run input

As this is a .NET application, you will need an available version of .NET 
on your system in order to compile and run the code.
