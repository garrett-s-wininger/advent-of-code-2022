# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 7 No Space on Device

This folder contains the attempted solution to the seventh Advent of Code 
2022 programming challenges. Our goal is to take in a set of terminal 
commands and their output in order to build a picture of the filesystem 
contents and its associated disk usage.

You can run the programming with the following command:

	php ./main.php

The only thing needed on your system is a working version of the PHP 
interpreter.
