# Advent of Code Day 3 - Rucksack Reorganization Part II

This folder contains the attempted solution to the second half of the 3rd 
Advent of Code 2022 programming challenges. The objective here is to take 
a file containing the items in rucksack compartments, identify the shared 
item in each set of 3 lines, and then output the sum of each group's 
priority.

You can run the program with the following:

	make
	java Main

Given that the implementation is in Java, you'll need a working JDK to 
build the code while only the JRE is necessary to run the solution.
