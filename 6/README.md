# Advent of Code - Day 6 Tuning Trouble

This folder contains the attempted solution to the sixth challenge of the 
2022 Advent of Code. Our goal is to identify the first "marker" which 
consists of four characters in a row which are different.

You can run the program with the following commands:

	autoreconf -i
	./configure
	make
	./main

In addition to autotools, you'll need a Fortran compiler on the system 
in order to build the code.
