# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 4 Camp Cleanup Part II

This folder contains an attempted solution for part 2 of the fourth Advent 
of Code 2022 challenges. In this, we want to find the number of overlapping 
ranges present in a provided input file.

The solution can be run with the following:

    ./main.m <filepath>

Octave was the chosen language for this portion so you'll need a compatible 
runtime environment if you want to run the script.
