# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 1 Calorie Counting Part II

This folder contains the attempted solution to the second part of the 2022 
Advent of Code Day 1 challenge. In this, we want to read a text file 
containing groups of numbers. We want to sum up each of these and find 
the sum of top 3 highest groups.

To build and run the program you can use the following invocation:

    make
    ./main <filepath>

As this is implemented in ADA, you will need a version of the GNAT tools for 
GCC to enable ADA compilation.
