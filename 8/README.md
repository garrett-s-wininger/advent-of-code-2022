# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 8 Treetop Tree House

This folder contains the attempted solution to the eight Advent of Code 
2022 challenges. In this, we want to take in a map of tree heights and 
output the number of trees which are visible from the outside of a 
given grid.

You can run the program with the following commands:

    ghc main.hs
    ./main input

The only requirement on your system should be a working GHC compiler 
for Haskell.
