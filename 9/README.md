# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 9 Rope Bridge

This folder contains the attempted solution to the ninth challenge of the 2022 
Advent of Code. In this, we would like to trace the movement of connected rope 
ends as they move across a bridge. In the end, we should be able to identify 
the number of unique positions that the tail of the rope had visited.

The application can be run with the following:

    dotnet run input

As a .NET application, the .NET runtime is required to be present on the local 
system in order to run the solution.
