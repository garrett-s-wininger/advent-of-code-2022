# Advent of Code Day 2 - Rock Paper Scissors

This folder contains the attempted solution to the second of the Advent of 
Code 22 programming challenges. For this, we want to take in a file of 
rock-paper-scissors strategies and output the overall score according to the
provided moves list. The implementation is based on the x86_64 calling 
convention, using GAS syntax calling into the C standard library.

You can run the program with the following invocation:

	make
	./main input

Make and the standard GCC package should be all you need.
