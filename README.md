# Advent of Code - 2022

This repository contains the source code as written for my attempt of the Advent 
of Code challenge for 2022. The days are separated into subfolders which map to 
each of the provided challenges. In each subfolder, you will find an additional 
README that specifies how the code within can be built and run.
