# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 13 Distress Signal Part

This folder contains the attempted solution for second half of the 13th Advent 
of Code 2022 challenge. In this, we want to parse signal inputs from the 
provided text file and compare each pair to determine whether they came in 
the right order. Once we figure out which pairs are correct, we can add up 
their indicies to obtain our final answer.

Running the solution can be done with the following:

    ./main.rb <filepath>

As this is a Ruby script, you only need a working interpreter on your local 
system in order to run the solution.
