# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 13 Distress Signal

This folder contains the attempted solution for the 13th Advent of Code 
2022 challenges. In this, we want to parse signal inputs from the 
provided text file and compare each pair to determine whether they came in 
the right order. Using this data, we can add up the proper indicies to 
get our final challenge answer.

Running the solution can be done with the following:

    cargo run -- <filepath>

As this is a Rust project, you'll need a working version of Cargo to 
build and run the application.
