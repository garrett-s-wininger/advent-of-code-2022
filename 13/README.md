# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 13 Distress Signal Part II

This folder contains the attempted solution for second half of the 13th Advent 
of Code 2022 challenge. In this, we want to parse signal inputs from the 
provided text file and compare each pair to determine whether they came in 
the right order. Using this ordering function, we can arrange all of the 
received packets in order to obtain the proper divider packet locations.

Running the solution can be done with the following:

    cargo run -- <filepath>

As this is a Rust project, you'll need a working version of Cargo to 
build and run the application.
