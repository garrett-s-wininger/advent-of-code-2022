# Advent of Code 2022 - Day 4 Camp Cleanup

This folder contains the attempted solution for the fourth of the Advent 
of Code 2022 programming challenges. We would like to take in a file, parse 
out the ranges and determine how many of them are overlapping which would 
result in additional work.

You can run the program with the following:

	erl
	c(main).
	main:main(input).

The only thing necessary on the system should be to have Erlang installed 
to ensure that the Beam VM is available.
